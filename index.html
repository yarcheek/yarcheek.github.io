story: >
  It started as a big dream of a small Czech startup Brand Embassy,
  to build the best product for digital customer support.
  
  So no matter what app, website, device customers use to contact a company,
  the message will always land. WhatsApp, Twitter, a review at Google maps review, comment on YouTube, you name it.
  
  Over time, we have integrated the biggest number of services on the market and even hacked WhatsApp to offer this service before they unveiled their public API. 
  Several years later, Czechcrunch wrote about Brand Embassy's successful exit and acquisition by a USA leader for customer support tool - NICE InContact.
  Now, we write a new era of the big dream getting even bigger - to become a global leader.
